----|----
Description:|Configures automatic user registration.
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|boolean
Default:|0

If this option is enabled and user sends available presence to Spectrum 2 instance (tries to login it), he is registered
automatically. If the available presence was join-the-room request, legacy network name used for registration is determined
according to resource of this presence. This basically means that if user wants to join for example IRC room #test%irc.freenode.org
as "HanzZ", then Spectrum 2 registers him as "HanzZ" automatically and he does not have to fill registration form manually.

#### registration.enable_public_registration

Key | val

----|----
Description:|Configures list of Jabber IDs, which has ability to use Admin Interface.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|list of Jabber IDs
Default:|empty list

This option configures list of Jabber IDs, which has ability to use Admin Interface. In server-mode, you also have to specify
service.admin_password to set password for Admin Interface. In gatewa-mode, you just specify the list of Jabber IDs, Spectrum 2 does
not check any password in gateway-mode.

#### service.admin_password

#### service.backend

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures path to backend executable.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures path to backend executable. When user connects, Spectrum 2 spawns new backend process to handle this user's
session. Usually single backend is shared by more users. This can be configured using service.users_per_backend.

#### service.backend_host

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures hostname or IP to which backend connects.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|localhost

This option configures hostname or IP to which backend connects. When Spectrum 2 is started, it listens on service.backend_port
to communicate with backends. When new backend is started, it connects to the hostname configured by this option and starts handling
new users sessions.

#### service.backend_port

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures port on which Spectrum 2 listens on for backends connections.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum 2 listens on for backends connections. If the value of this option is 0, then Spectrum 2
uses randomly generated port number.


#### service.group

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures group under which Spectrum 2 instance runs.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures name of group under which Spectrum 2 instance runs. When Spectrum 2 is started, it switches from current group
to this group.


#### service.jid

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures Jabber ID of Spectrum 2 instance
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures Jabber ID of particular Spectrum 2 instance. Usually it is a hostname on which this Spectrum 2 instance
runs, so for example `icq.domain.tld`. Note that you have to have DNS records configured for this hostname, so clients will be able
to find out your Jabber server (in case you are running Spectrum 2 in gateway-mode) or the Spectrum 2 itself (if you are running
Spectrum 2 in server-mode).

#### service.password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password to be used to connect XMPP server
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode. In server-mode
the default port for XMPP servers is 5222, so you should use this port. In gateway-mode, you have to at first configure your
server to allow Spectrum 2 to connect it as its component. On many servers, the default component port is 5347, but this option
depends on particular XMPP server and its configuration.

#### service.pidfile

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures path to file when Spectrum 2 stores its process ID.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|/var/run/spectrum2/$jid.pid

This option configures path to file when Spectrum 2 stores its process ID. This file is later used by `spectrum2_manager` to determine,
if this particular Spectrum 2 instance runs.

#### service.user

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures user under which Spectrum 2 instance runs.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures name of user under which Spectrum 2 instance runs. When Spectrum 2 is started, it switches from current user
(usually root) to this user.


#### service.users_per_backend

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures maximum number of users who share single backend process.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|100

This option configures maximum number of users who share single backend process. Value of this option depends on number of online
users on your Spectrum 2 instance in the same time. There is no strict consensus on what is the best value. Every backend is separated
process and you probably want to keep the number of processes per Spectrum 2 instance less than 30. So if you have 1000 users, it
could be sane to use `users_per_backend=50`. Another idea is to have the same number of backends as the number of CPU cores of the
machine where Spectrum 2 is running.

If you have too big value of users_per_backend, you have just single backend process for all users and Spectrum 2 will not perform so well
as if you have more backends running for the same user-base. Also, if there is some problem with single backend, it will affects only users
connected using this particular backend, so it is good idea to have more backends running. However, the more backends you have
the more processes the machine has and since some point, it will become less useful. There is also some memory overhead, so if you run
500 users on single backend, it will take little bit less memory than 500 users on 5 backends (but it is not significant unless you decide
to have hundreds of backends).

If you presume to have just few users on your personal server, it can be useful to configure `service.users_per_backend=1`. Ever user will
get his own separated backend process.

For bigger user-base, you have to increase the `service.users_per_backend` value, but there is no optimal value to be suggested yet.


#### service.web_directory

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Full path to directory used to save files to which the links are sent to users.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|

When Spectrum 2 has some image or file for the user and this option is set, the image or file is stored in this directory and
and link based on `service.web_url` is sent to the user so he can download the file.

You can read more about this configuration on [Web Storage page](web_storage.html).

#### service.web_url

Key | val
----|----
Description:|URL on which files in `service.web_directory` are accessible.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|

When Spectrum 2 has some image or file for the user and this option is set, the image or file is stored in the `service.web_directory` directory and
and link based on `service.web_url` is sent to the user so he can download the file.
